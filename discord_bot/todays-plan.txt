# Livecoding Today

Welcome.

We're writing a Discord bot to
update status from my FreeCodeCamp
profile into the #detroit-FreeCodeCamp
channel.

Whoa, acoustic guitar sound effects!

We'll continue as far as we can,
without versioning our code. The review
is good for building character :)

New laptop, y'know...
XCode tools installed!
I managed to install Python packages without
knowing my root password? Okay... :shrug:

## Parts
1) Write an empty Discord Python bot that just says hello in channel
2) Download FreeCodeCamp challenge names, save to Redis
3) Call the FCC API to download our profile
...
more to come in the future!

# Part 1: Write an empty Discord bot

We're waiting for XCode to finish installing.

# Part 2: FCC Challenge names

We saved this in a file called challenge-names.json
from the API endpoint:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/page-data/sq/d/4195245674.json

We have no way of knowing this except Web Inspector.
It's not documented anywhere AFAIK.

# Part 3: FCC Profile 

We are getting this from
https://api.freecodecamp.org/api/users/get-public-profile?username=paulpham

You can substitute your own username instead of "paulpham"

We saved this in a file called `profile-paulpham.json`



We're ending in one hour instead of
in two hours, as the cafe I'm in
is closing :/
